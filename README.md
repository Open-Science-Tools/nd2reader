### About

`nd2reader` is a pure-Python package that reads images produced by NIS Elements 4.0+. It has only been definitively tested on NIS Elements 4.30.02 Build 1053. Support for older versions is being actively worked on.
The reader is written in the [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) framework, enabling easy access to multidimensional files, lazy slicing, and nice display in IPython.

### Documentation

The documentation is available [here](http://www.lighthacking.nl/nd2reader/).

### Installation

The package is available on PyPi. Install it using:

```
pip install nd2reader
```

If you don't already have the packages `numpy`, `pims`, `six` and `xmltodict`, they will be installed automatically if you use the `setup.py` script.
Python >= 3.5 are supported.

#### Installation via Conda Forge

Installing `nd2reader` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `nd2reader` can be installed with:

```
conda install nd2reader
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `nd2reader` available on your platform with:

```
conda search nd2reader --channel conda-forge
```

### ND2s

`nd2reader` follows the [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) framework. To open a file and show the first frame:

```python
from nd2reader import ND2Reader
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with ND2Reader('my_directory/example.nd2') as images:
  plt.imshow(images[0])
```

After opening the file, all `pims` features are supported. Please refer to the [pims documentation](http://soft-matter.github.io/pims/).

#### Backwards compatibility

Older versions of `nd2reader` do not use the `pims` framework. To provide backwards compatibility, a legacy [Nd2](http://www.lighthacking.nl/nd2reader/nd2reader.html#module-nd2reader.legacy) class is provided.
